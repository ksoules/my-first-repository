# README #

This is the first time I am making a change to the README file. 
- I think starting from the local and then connecting to the remote makes more sense to me.
- but I am glad to have clear instructions now for both

# Process
1. Create a local directy and initialize it as a git repository
1. as you make changes to files, add them to the staging area
1. when you are ready, commit a batch of changes and include a message about those changes
1. push the commit to the remost repository
